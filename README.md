### 💡 About Me

A dedicated Software QA Engineer with a strong foundation in both manual and automation testing. I enjoy ensuring software quality through systematic testing, problem-solving, and continuous improvement.

Rather than limiting myself to specific tools or frameworks, I focus on building a growth mindset, learning quickly, and adapting to new technologies as they emerge. I believe testing is more than just finding bugs—it’s about delivering reliable, user-friendly, and high-quality software.

My core values as a QA professional are:

🔹 Curiosity – asking the right questions to uncover hidden issues

🔹 Detail-orientation – ensuring nothing slips through unnoticed

🔹 Adaptability – embracing new tools, technologies, and approaches

🔹 Collaboration – working closely with teams to achieve shared goals

I see myself as a lifelong learner, continuously upgrading my skills—whether in test automation, API testing, performance testing, or new QA methodologies—to stay relevant and valuable in the ever-evolving world of software development.
